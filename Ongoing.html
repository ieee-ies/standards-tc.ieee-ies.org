          On-going Activities

        The Standards Committee holds numerous standards activities throughout the year, mostly associated with Working Group meetings.
        Working Group meetings are usually held at intervals of 6 to 8 weeks, via WebEX conferencing or other online conferencing systems to accommodate members from multiple geographical regions. Face to face Working Group meetings are also held during the main IES conferences coinciding with AdCom meetings, notably at ISIE and IECON conferences. Face to face meetings will include online conferencing to accommodate members unable to physically attend.
Standards Technical Committee meetings are held twice a year, normally coinciding with IES AdCom meetings at ISIE and IECON conferences. TC status reports are usually covered at these meetings plus new activities discussion.

              <a href="http://www.ieee-ies.org/technical-committees" target="_blank">IEEE IES Technical Committees</a>
             1.	IEEE P21451-002 PAR. Recommended Practice for Low Power Smart Transducers Applications
             ●	Co-sponsored with the Instrumentation and Measurements Society (IMS)
●	SCOPE: This recommended practice establishes operating aspects and additional Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) based on the IEEE 1451 family of standards for low-power smart sensors and actuators, concerning the signal conditioning electronics and the processing unit operation. The recommended practice also defines protocols for accessing TEDS and smart transducer data with restrictions on energy, battery power, and energy harvested from the environment. Operating aspects and protocol implementation should adhere to computational restrictions of low-power smart transducers, available memory, or execution speed. 
●	Approved PAR by IEEE-SA (See P1451.001[1])
●	Working Group (WG) Chair: Antonio Espirito-Santos, IES member
●	WG Vice Chair: TBD
●	Status: Standard in development

            2.	IEEE P2668 PAR. Standard for Maturity Index of Internet-of-things: Evaluation, Grading and Ranking
●	SCOPE: Ethernet The scope of this standard is to measure the maturity of objects in Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment, namely IoT objects. IoT objects shall represent things or devices or the entire system. The standard defines the mechanism and specifications for evaluation, grading and ranking of the performance of IoT objects by using indicator values, referred as IoT Index (IDex). IDex shall classify the objects into multiple levels of performance and give a quantitative representation and indication of the performance of objects. IDex shall manifest guidance on blending of IoT objects to evolve into better performance.
●	Approved modified PAR by IEEE-SA (See P2668_PAR_Detail.pdf)
●	WG Chair: Kim Fung Tsang, IES member
●	WG Vice Chair: Victor Huang, IES member
●	Secretary: TBD
●	Status: Standard in development
