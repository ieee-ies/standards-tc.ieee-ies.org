          On-going Activities
        </div>
        
        The Standards Committee holds numerous standards activities throughout the year, mostly associated with Working Group meetings.
        Working Group meetings are usually held at intervals of 6 to 8 weeks, via WebEX conferencing or other online conferencing systems to accommodate members from multiple geographical regions. Face to face Working Group meetings are also held during the main IES conferences coinciding with AdCom meetings, notably at ISIE and IECON conferences. Face to face meetings will include online conferencing to accommodate members unable to physically attend.
Standards Technical Committee meetings are held twice a year, normally coinciding with IES AdCom meetings at ISIE and IECON conferences. 
        
        <br>
        TC status reports are usually covered at these meetings plus new activities discussion.

        <p><b>On-going Working Groups:</b></p>
